# Title
Analyzing differential gene expression between African American and Caucasian prostate cancer patients.

## Author: 
Lynn Yang (seolynya@usc.edu)

## Overview of project:
•	RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool that is frequently used for gene expression analysis. Starting with the sequenced data, analysis can be conducted to determine differentially expressed genes. 

•	My project will be on utilizing the Bioconductor tool to analyze differential gene expression between African American and Caucasian prostate cancer patients.  

•	I will be following this vignette: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/limmaWorkflow.html

## Data:
•	Data will be obtained from the TCGA database on GDC.

Caucasian men with prostate cancer:

## Milestone 1
•	My first milestone is to download 10 raw datasets in HT-seq format for each group (total 20) from TCGA and load them onto R. These datasets will be used for vignettes.

## Milestone 2
•	I’ll be generating plots of the differentially expressed genes, as well as generate differential analysis.

## Deliverable
•	R MarkDown
